# My-project-Synthria
Synthria is a new way to compose music—you don’t write notes, you draw them. Every line, color, and curve expresses emotion and sonic intent. It’s a visual, intuitive, and deeply expressive tool that turns the traditional piano roll into a musical canvas. Perfect to experiment with new forms of musical creation.
