# My-project-Synthria
Synthria is a new way to compose music—you don’t write notes, you draw them. Every line, color, and curve expresses emotion and sonic intent. It’s a visual, intuitive, and deeply expressive tool that turns the traditional piano roll into a musical canvas. Perfect to experiment with new forms of musical creation.

Call for attention: Help Build a Visual Music Composition Tool (Synthria)
What is Synthria? 
It’s a creative tool where users draw sound. Each line, color, and curve represents musical intent. The goal is to transform the traditional piano roll into an expressive, intuitive, and emotionally resonant experience. This isn’t just software—it’s functional art.

A functional MVP in 6–8 weeks that includes:
A visual interface for drawing music
Stroke-to-MIDI translation
Basic export functionality
Color mapping
Sound preview or playback
